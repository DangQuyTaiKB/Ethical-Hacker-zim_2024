    "### 1.4.1 What Did I Learn in this Module?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing**\n",
    "- This topic covers ethical hacking and penetration testing, explaining that an ethical hacker is someone who uses the same tools as nonethical hackers to find vulnerabilities in a network's or system's infrastructure but reports their findings to the vendor or customer to help make the system more secure. \n",
    "- The purpose of penetration testing is to identify possible paths of compromise before malicious attackers do. It is important to evaluate and test the effectiveness of defensive techniques used to secure and defend networks and systems, and this is where penetration testing comes in. \n",
    "- The topic also describes different types of threat actors, including organized crime, hacktivists, state-sponsored attackers, and insider threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring Penetration Testing Methodologies**\n",
    "- This topic discusses the importance of using a methodology for penetration testing to avoid scope creep and providing documentation of a specialized procedure that has been used successfully by many organizations to test their network and data infrastructures. \n",
    "- It also lists different types of penetration tests, including network infrastructure tests, application-based tests, and penetration testing in the cloud. \n",
    "- The topic further explains the different perspectives from which testing is performed, including unknown-environment testing, known-environment testing, and partially known environment testing. \n",
    "- Lastly, the topic provides an overview of various penetration testing methodologies, including MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP WSTG, NIST SP 800-115, OSSTMM, PTES, and ISSAF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building Your Own Lab**\n",
    "- This topic discusses the importance of a proper lab environment for penetration testing and the different types of tools used in the testing process. It emphasizes the need to test tools and techniques in a lab environment before running them against a customer network to avoid breaking anything. Requirements for a typical penetration testing lab are discussed, including a closed network, virtualized computing environment, realistic environment, health monitoring, sufficient hardware resources, multiple operating systems, duplicate tools, and practice targets. \n",
    "- The types of tools used in penetration testing depend on the type of testing being done, such as network infrastructure-based tools, web application testing tools, automated vulnerability scanning tools, and mobile application testing tools. It is important to have a recovery method in case something breaks during testing.\n",

    "-**Answer**: hacktivists\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a state-sponsored attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: An attack perpetrated by governments worldwide to disrupt or steal information from other nations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: An attack perpetrated by disgruntled employees inside an organization\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What kind of security weakness is evaluated by application-based penetration tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: logic flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What two resources are evaluated by a network infrastructure penetration test? (Choose two.)\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: AAA servers (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting servers) and IPSs (Intrusion Prevention Systems). These components are crucial for maintaining network security and are often targeted to identify potential vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. When conducting an application-based penetration test on a web application, the assessment should also include testing access to which resources?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: back-end databases. These databases often store sensitive information, and ensuring their security is crucial to protecting the overall application.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the purpose of bug bounty programs used by companies?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: reward security professionals for finding vulnerabilities in the systems of the company\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What characterizes a partially known environment penetration test?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: The test is a hybrid approach between unknown and known environment tests\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What characterizes a known environment penetration test?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: The tester could be provided with network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, and user credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Which type of penetration test would only provide the tester with limited information such as the domain names and IP addresses in the scope?\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Answer**: unknown-environment penetration test (previously known as black-box), the tester typically only has a very limited amount of information. For instance, the tester may only provide the domain names and IP addresses in scope for a particular target. The tester would have yet to gain prior knowledge of the organization's target and infrastructure.\n",
